# 🧠 Building Systems That Think

**Backend • Distributed Systems • CLI Tools • Systems Programming**

I'm Nate - a developer who builds the engines, not the interfaces. I grew up on Usenet, so distributed systems and network protocols feel like home. I focus on making intelligent software that works at the system level, not flashy UIs.

## What I'm Building

🌤️ **[Weather Intelligence System](https://github.com/Redsskull/weather-intelligence-system)** - Go + Python hybrid system with pattern recognition and concurrent data collection. Making two languages talk through JSON orchestration.

🎮 **[Warcraft Logs CLI](https://github.com/Redsskull/wclogs-cli)** - GraphQL API wrapper with OAuth2 authentication. Learned GraphQL by building a real tool, not following tutorials.

⚔️ **[War Card Game](https://github.com/Redsskull/war-card-game)** - My first complete project (CS50 final). Cross-platform Go GUI with Fyne, teaching me about asset bundling, cross-compilation, and actually shipping software.

💬 **P2P Chat System** *(in progress)* - IRC-style distributed chat. Because I understand how the internet actually works, not just how to `npm install` things.

## My Philosophy

> "I build minds, not just software. I understand distributed systems from the Usenet era. I write CLI tools because I care about the engine, not the paint."

I don't make GUIs (I'm terrible at them). I build:
- Systems that think and learn
- Distributed networks that communicate
- CLI tools that solve real problems
- Backend services that others depend on

## Tech Stack

**Primary:** Go, Python, Bash, Podman
**Learning:** Distributed systems, P2P protocols, GraphQL, system architecture
**Approach:** Build real projects, bash head against wall, learn deeply
```go
// My coding philosophy in Go
func approach(problem Challenge) Solution {
    for !problem.Solved() {
        try(problem)
        learn(mistakes)
        iterate()
    }
    return ship(solution)
}
```

## What Makes Me Different

- 📡 **Usenet background** - I understand distributed systems at a fundamental level
- 🔧 **CLI-first** - Terminal tools over web UIs every time
- 🧠 **Systems thinking** - I build the basement, not the penthouse
- 🚀 **Ship-focused** - I finish projects, even when they're hard
- 💬 **Honest learner** - I document my journey, including the struggles

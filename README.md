# 🧠 Building Systems That Think

**Backend • Distributed Systems • CLI Tools • Systems Programming**

I'm Nate - a developer who builds intelligent systems from the ground up. I grew up on IRC, Usenet, and Hotline on my dad's Macintosh, so distributed systems and network protocols feel natural to me. I focus on making software that works at the system level, whether that's through terminal interfaces or the occasional GUI when it fits the project.

## What I'm Building

🌤️ **[Weather Intelligence System](https://github.com/Redsskull/weather-intelligence-system)** - Go + Python hybrid system with pattern recognition and concurrent data collection. Making two languages talk through JSON orchestration.

🎮 **[Warcraft Logs CLI](https://github.com/Redsskull/wclogs-cli)** - GraphQL API wrapper with OAuth2 authentication. Learned GraphQL by building a real tool for exploring combat log data.

⚔️ **[War Card Game](https://github.com/Redsskull/war-card-game)** - My first complete project (CS50 final). Cross-platform Go GUI with Fyne framework, teaching me about asset bundling, cross-compilation, and shipping polished software.

📖 **Knights and Creatures** - Python text adventure with branching narratives and class-specific story paths. My first solo project, inspired by Asimov's storytelling.

💬 **P2P Chat System** *(in progress)* - IRC-style distributed chat. Building on my early internet roots with modern Go.

## My Philosophy

> "I build minds, not just software. I grew up on IRC and Usenet, so I understand how distributed systems work at a fundamental level. I prefer CLI tools because I care about the engine, but I'll build a GUI when the project needs it."

I focus on:
- Systems that think and learn
- Distributed networks that communicate
- Tools that solve real problems
- Backend services that others depend on

## Tech Stack

**Primary:** Go, Python, Bash, Podman
**Learning:** Distributed systems, P2P protocols, GraphQL, system architecture
**Background:** IRC, Usenet, Hotline - grew up understanding how networks actually work

```go
// My coding philosophy in Go
func approach(problem Challenge) Solution {
    for !problem.Solved() {
        try(problem)
        learn(mistakes)
        iterate()
    }
    return ship(solution)
}
```

## What Makes Me Different

- 📡 **Early Internet Background** - IRC, Usenet, Hotline on classic Mac - I understand distributed systems from experience, not just textbooks
- 🔧 **Systems Thinking** - I build from the foundation up, focusing on how things work internally
- 🧠 **Intelligence-Focused** - From weather prediction to emergent game systems, I care about making software that thinks
- 📖 **Code as Story** - From Asimov-inspired text adventures to intelligent weather systems
- 🚀 **Ship-Focused** - I finish projects, even when they're hard
- 💬 **Honest Learner** - I document my journey, including the struggles

## Recent Wins

- ✅ Built weather prediction system with Go + Python orchestration
- ✅ Learned GraphQL by integrating with complex Warcraft Logs API
- ✅ Shipped complete cross-platform game as CS50 final project
- ✅ Created branching text adventure inspired by Asimov's storytelling
- ✅ Hacktoberfest contributor (CI/CD, pytest, open source)
- ✅ Made Python and Go talk through JSON (harder than it sounds)
